Things to do:
- VAE
- LSTMLayer
- BiLSTMLayer
- EmbeddingLayer

examples:
- add MNIST example w/ standard tensorflow tutorial network
- add vae example for image analysis
- add highway network example
- add style transfer example
- add pretrained residual network for image analysis
- add pretrained inception network for image analysis
- add pretrained alexnet for image analysis
- add densenet for image analysis

other things:
- more flexibility to regularize each layer with different strengths
